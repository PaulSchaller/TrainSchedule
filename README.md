# TrainSchedule

## This project controls and displays a train schedule.

In the project development, I used the Firebase database to host arrival and departure data.  *Moment.js* was used to 
retrieve and manipulate the arrival and departure data.  The train schedule displayed the arrival times of various trains
and the number of minutes remaining until the trains would arrive at their train stations.  I also used html, javascript, 
jQuery, and css in the development.

The website is deployed at https://paulschaller.github.io/TrainSchedule/


This is the initial screen of the website.  Once the user clicks on the *start* button, the train schedule displays.

This screen shows the train schedule, the current time, and a form to add new trains to the schedule.
